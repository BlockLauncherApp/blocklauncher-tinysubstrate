Builds a tiny libsubstrate for Android.

You shouldn't need this: BlockLauncher's main repo
[already includes](https://github.com/zhuowei/MCPELauncher/tree/master/prebuilts/tinysubstrate-bin)
a prebuilt copy of this library.

Clone [blocklauncher-libsubstrate](https://github.com/BlockLauncherApp/blocklauncher-libsubstrate),
symlink it to `jni` in this directory, and run `ndk-build`.

See [the main BlockLauncher repository](https://github.com/zhuowei/MCPELauncher) for more information.
